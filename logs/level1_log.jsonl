As sunlight enters the atmosphere, it collides with tiny air molecules.\n3. This collision causes the sunlight to scatter in different directions.\n4. Blue and violet light have shorter wavelengths and scatter more easily than other colors.\n5.  More blue light is scattered than other colors.\n6. Our eyes are more sensitive to blue than violet.\n7. Therefore, we perceive the sky as blue.\n\n**Answer:** The sky is blue because of the scattering of sunlight by air molecules in the atmosphere.", "level": 1}
